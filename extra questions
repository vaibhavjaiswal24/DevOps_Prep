🛠️ CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT–SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
1. What is Configuration Management in DevOps?

Answer:
“Configuration Management ensures consistency across code, builds, environments, and infrastructure.
It manages changes in source code, build scripts, dependencies, environment configurations, and deployment artifacts so that every build is repeatable and reliable.”

2. What are key CM responsibilities?

Answer:
“Key CM responsibilities include:

Managing version control systems (branching, merging, tagging)

Maintaining build and release processes

Managing configuration changes for builds and environments

Ensuring consistency across development, SIT, QA, and production

Creating automation to improve developer productivity

Standardizing tools and processes for build, test, and release”

3. What is the difference between CM and Release Engineering?

Answer:
“Configuration Management focuses on how code and systems are structured, including version control, build configs, scripts, and reproducibility.
Release Engineering focuses on how software is packaged, deployed, and delivered across environments.
CM ensures consistency; Release Engineering ensures delivery.”

4. How do you maintain consistency across builds?

Answer:
“I maintain consistency by:

Pinning dependency versions

Using standardized Gradle or CI/CD templates

Storing all configs in version control

Using immutable build agents or containers

Automating build validation and code quality gates

Tagging builds and generating artifacts systematically”

5. What tools have you used for CM?

Answer:
“My primary CM tools are Git, GitHub, and SVN.
I handled branching strategy, governance, access controls, PR rules, and performed a full SVN→Git migration with history preservation.”

6. How do you track changes to build configs, scripts, infra code?

Answer:
“I treat all configurations as code—build scripts, YAML CI/CD pipelines, Terraform modules, and automation scripts are stored in Git and follow the same review, versioning, and tagging process as application code.”

7. Explain your experience with versioning strategies.

Answer:
“I use Semantic Versioning—MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
I automate tagging in CI so every build has a traceable version.
For libraries or modular builds, I use Gradle’s version catalogs to manage versions centrally.”

🌿 BRANCHING + CODE STREAMS QUESTIONS
1. Explain branching strategies you implemented.

Answer:
“I implemented GitFlow-like workflows with:

main/master → production

develop → integration

feature branches → individual work

release branches → stabilization

hotfix branches → critical fixes
I enforced PR approvals, branch protection, and automated checks.”

2. How do you manage long-lived branches?

Answer:
“I avoid long-lived branches, but if required:

I rebase/merge them with develop frequently

Perform code scans

Keep their scope small

Ensure early integration to reduce conflicts”

3. What is the difference between merge and rebase?

Answer:
“Merge creates a new commit combining histories; rebase rewrites history by placing your changes on top of another branch.
Merge is safe; rebase gives a cleaner linear history.”

4. How do you avoid merge conflicts?

Answer:
“Frequent merges/rebases, smaller feature branches, using code owners, enforcing reviews, and detecting conflicts via CI checks before merging.”

5. How did you handle code history in SVN→Git migration?

Answer:
“I preserved full commit history using git-svn, mapped authors, cleaned repository structure, and validated commits after migration.
Then I trained teams on Git usage and branching.”

6. How do you manage multiple repos for large projects?

Answer:
“I standardize folder structure, maintain shared Gradle modules/libraries, create reusable pipeline templates, and enforce consistent branching and tagging across all repos.”

7. How do you ensure developers follow Git standards?

Answer:
“I enforce branch protections, PR templates, code reviews, and automated checks for builds/quality.
I also conduct Git training sessions and provide documentation.”

⚙️ BUILD ENGINEERING & RELEASE MANAGEMENT QUESTIONS
1. What challenges did you face in Ant → Gradle migration?

Answer:
“The biggest challenges were dependency mapping, build file restructuring, modularizing tasks, and integrating with CI/CD.
I resolved them by creating multi-module Gradle builds, using dependency catalogs, and testing each module independently.”

2. How does Gradle improve build performance?

Answer:
“Gradle improves performance through:

Incremental builds

Build caching

Parallel execution

Task avoidance
These features significantly reduced our build time by 40%.”

3. What is a build cache?

Answer:
“Gradle’s build cache stores outputs of previous tasks.
If inputs haven’t changed, Gradle reuses cached outputs instead of re-executing the task.”

4. How do you set up Gradle in CI/CD?

Answer:
“I configure:

Gradle wrapper

Caching strategies (local & remote)

Dependency scanning

SonarQube integration

Test execution

Artifact packaging

Version tagging
I use YAML pipelines and reusable templates.”

5. How do you handle build dependencies?

Answer:
“I pin dependency versions, use version catalogs, generate dependency locks, and validate dependencies using Gradle’s dependencyInsight.”

6. What is your experience with Bamboo & Azure DevOps?

Answer:
“I automated build and patch deployment pipelines in Bamboo using scripts and integrated several project pipelines into Azure DevOps.
I also created templates, variable groups, service connections, and quality gates.”

7. How do you ensure consistent build artifacts across environments?

Answer:
“By using immutable artifacts, version-tagged builds, pinned dependencies, centralized templates, and storing everything in artifact repositories instead of rebuilding.”

🐍 SCRIPTING & AUTOMATION QUESTIONS
1. What Python scripts have you built?

Answer:
“I built:

ADO bug analysis automation (processed 5,000+ bugs)

SonarQube summary generator

Secret-detection Git pre-commit hook

Hung-thread detection & server restart scripts

Patch deployment automation
These scripts significantly reduced manual effort.”

2. How do you call REST APIs in Python?

Answer:
“Using the requests library:

I authenticate using PAT or OAuth

Make GET/POST calls

Parse JSON

Handle pagination

Export results to Excel or CSV”

3. Explain multiprocessing/batch optimization for 5,000+ bug processing.

Answer:
“I divided API requests into batches and used multiprocessing to call APIs in parallel.
This reduced execution time drastically and prevented rate-limit throttling.”

4. How do you handle exceptions/logging in scripts?

Answer:
“I use try-except blocks, structured logs, timestamps, log rotation, and detailed error messages so debugging becomes straightforward.”

5. How do you schedule automation tasks?

Answer:
“Using cron jobs on Linux or scheduled pipelines in Azure DevOps.
For some scripts, I integrate them directly into CI/CD.”

6. How do you write scripts that support CI/CD tools?

Answer:
“I parameterize scripts, avoid hard-coded paths, log outputs, return exit codes properly, and package scripts in repo folders so pipelines can call them easily.”

🐧 LINUX/UNIX TROUBLESHOOTING QUESTIONS
1. Common Linux commands you use daily?

Answer:
“ps, top, grep, tail, sed, awk, du, df, netstat/ss, chmod, chown, kill, find, scp, journalctl, systemctl.”

2. How to check process health / threads / memory?

Answer:
“I use:

ps -ef → running processes

top / htop → live CPU/memory usage

pmap → memory maps

jstack for Java thread dumps

free -m → RAM usage

vmstat / iostat for system health”

3. How to kill hung processes or detect high CPU?

Answer:
“Detect via top, ps, or thread dumps.
Kill using kill -9 <PID> if graceful shutdown fails.
I also analyze logs to prevent recurrence.”

4. How do you debug build failures in Unix environments?

Answer:
“Check logs, environment variables, file permissions, dependency paths, Java versions, missing tools, or inconsistent agent configurations.”

5. How do you manage file permissions in Unix?

Answer:
“Using chmod, chown, and umask.
I ensure service accounts and pipeline agents have restricted but required permissions.”
