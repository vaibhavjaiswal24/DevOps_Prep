🎤 1-Minute Self-Introduction (Powerful & Professional)

**“Good morning/afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity.
My name is Vaibhav Jaiswal, and I’m a DevOps Engineer with a little over 3 years of experience focusing on Configuration Management, CI/CD automation, and build engineering.

At Deloitte, I’ve led several large-scale modernization initiatives such as migrating Ant to Gradle, SVN to Git, and WebSphere to Liberty. These projects helped improve build performance by 40%, deployment speed by 70%, and significantly enhanced developer productivity.

I have strong hands-on expertise with Git, Azure DevOps, Gradle, Linux, SonarQube, and Python automation. I’ve also developed multiple productivity tools—like ADO bug analysis automation, server restart and thread monitoring scripts, and a Sonar summary generator—that reduced manual effort across teams.

I enjoy solving complex build, release, and automation challenges and standardizing processes across engineering teams. I’m now looking for a Configuration Management/DevOps role where I can apply this experience, contribute to scalable solutions, and continue growing as a build and release engineer.”**

⭐ “Why Should We Hire You?” — Impactful Closing Pitch

**“You should hire me because I bring the exact combination of skills this role requires—strong Configuration Management experience, deep understanding of Git and branching strategies, hands-on build engineering expertise with Gradle, and proven success in automating and optimizing CI/CD pipelines.

I’ve already delivered complex migrations and built automation tools that saved teams significant time and effort. I don’t just follow processes; I improve them, standardize them, and make them scalable for long-term use.

I’m someone who takes ownership, solves problems proactively, and supports teams with documentation, training, and hands-on collaboration. I’m confident I can add immediate value to your CM and DevOps initiatives and help strengthen your build, release, and automation ecosystem.”**
